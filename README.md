Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
=========================
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

To perform this assignment we followed these steps:  
1.Downloading and unzipping file  
2.Reading data from the all files  
3.Merging the training and test sets to create one data set  

Finally, we creat a txt file from the new dataset and shar it with others by uploading it to Github.
