Getting-and-Cleaning-Data  
=========================

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

To perform this assignment we followed these steps:    
1. Downloading and unzipping file    
2. Reading data from the all files    
3. Merging the training and test sets to create one dataset that has all variables (subjects activity, and features) from training and test datasets.  

Finally, we creat a txt file **tidy_data** from the new dataset and shar it with others by uploading it to Github.
