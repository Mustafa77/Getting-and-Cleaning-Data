#CodeBook for the tidy dataset  
  


###Source of the Dataset:  
This dataset is based on the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" project which was extracted from the following website:"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones"  

So, the first step in this analysis was data Extraction by downloading and unzipping file   


###Data Managment & Processing of Variables:
After unzipping the files; we went over the list of files in the folder UCI HAR Dataset. The original dataset about subjects activity, and features had training and test datasets.  
* First, we started by reading those datasets first (subjects activity, and features). 
* second, we merged training and test datasets to create one data set.
* Third, we did more processing of variables to include varialbes with summarized information (mean & standard deviation) in the final dataset


####Please notice the following:
* We use a simple **programing code to label**  the values of activity variable instead of using the file in UCI HAR Dataset.
* For anyone who want to analyze this final tidy dataset should notice the summarized variables with an ending like "mean()-X and std()-X"- like the **following examples**:   

fBodyAccMag-mean()"   
"fBodyAccMag-std()"   
"fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()"   
"fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()"     
"fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()"   
"fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()
